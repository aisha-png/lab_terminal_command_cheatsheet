# **Terminal Cheatsheet**
## Here is a list of commands and what they do:
---
1. Change Directory 'cd' - This will change the directory that you're currently working with in the Terminal in order to execute other commands on a different directory.
2. List 'ls' - This will allow you to see the file and directories within your current directory.
3. Copy 'cp' - This command is used to copy a file from one location to another or to simply copy the same file with a new name.
4. Move 'mv' - This command will help you move a file from the original location to a new location.
5. Open 'open' - this is used to open files in your computer with the app that can open that file on your Mac.
6. Touch 'touch' - This command will allow you to create any file type. Once the file is created, it will be blank but you can open it in a text editor by typing open [filename]
7. To create a new directory 'mkdir' - This will allow you to add a new directory or file within the current working directory **OR** specify a full path to the location where you want the new directory to be placed.
8. Super user do 'sudo' - is a command that allows you to elevate your user privileges while executing the command to administrator privileges. This is needed for some commands to run for example, removing a file that is owned by another user.
9. 'q' - For commands that run continuously when executed, you can end execution of the process by pressing the q key on your keyboard. Alternatively you can also press Control+C.
10. 'rmdir' - If you want to remove a directory altogether, use the rmdir command followed by the path to the directory.
11. 'rm -R' - When this command is executed, all files and directories inside of the path you specify will be deleted immediately. However, it is important to note that this command is **irreverible**.
12. 'clear' - This command removes all previously typed commands from the Terminal view and gives you back a clean slate to work from.
13. 'ditto' - The ditto command will execute a copy of all of the contents of one folder into another folder that you specify. This is great for when you need to start a new project and use an older project as a base.
14. 'whatis' - When you want to get a short description of a command and what it does on your Mac, use this command to find out.
15. 'exit' - This command will close out the current session in the Terminal. You can also simply close the window, but that may not be possible when you're using SSH through Terminal to access a remote machine. In this instance, you'll want to use exit to hang up that remote connection before closing the window.
